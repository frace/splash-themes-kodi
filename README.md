I started to create some themes for the fbsplash/splashutils/fbcondecor around four years ago but never managed to finish and polish them due to time constraints.
Nevertheless I wanted to push them to the public and a vcs for some time now. Maybe I'll get some fresh motivation to finish it.
It is usable but has some limitations.

- No status icons (not sure if I ever wanted that at all)
- Currently only 1280x720 resolution is supported
- The shutdown splash is in an unfinished state
- Don't know if resume or suspend splashes work at all
- A lot of cruft/mess inside the directories and files
- No ebuild available
